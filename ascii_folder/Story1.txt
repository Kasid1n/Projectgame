Cold... is what you are feeling.... You wake up from a deep slumber. 
Other things you can sense is bitter smells in the air and wetness of a puddle you are laying on.
You look around just to see stone walls decorated with spider webs and moss.
And there is a fainted light iluminate from the deep of the unfamiliar hallways.
You then remember what you came here for and start to advance forward.
